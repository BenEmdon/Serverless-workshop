Intro to Serverless Computing workshop


## What is Serverless Computing?
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider (ex. AWS) runs the server and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources.

So *'Serverless'* still has servers, it's just the servers arent managed by the developer.
Pricing is based on actual resources consumed, instead of pre-purchased units of capacity.
